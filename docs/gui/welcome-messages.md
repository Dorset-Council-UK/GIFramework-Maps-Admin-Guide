# Welcome messages

The welcome message is a popup that can appear when you first load the map. Welcome messages are configurable per version.

## Add a new welcome message

Select **Add new welcome message** and fill in the details:

- Name
- Title - this will appear in bold at the top of your welcome message
- Content - add your message here and make sure to include HTML markup for paragraphs `<p>`, headers `<h2>` and links `<a href ... >`
- How often you want the message to show
- Update date - a date when the message has been updated enough to reshow it to users
- Dismiss using button only - tick the checkbox if you want users to *only* be able to dismiss your message by using the dismiss button
- Dismiss button text - this defaults to Close if you leave it blank

!!! hint
    Ticking the **dismiss using button only** box and choosing an update frequency of **Just once** or **Always**, with custom dismiss button text can work as a *reasonable* alternative to a standard 'Agree to our terms' screen. For user experience reasons, try not to do this too much if you don't need to
